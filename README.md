# Robocode-2023
Robocode competition for CS4076 

General Rules:

Advanced Robots and Normal Robots are allowed to use.

Score:

We will use the default score system, which means you gain score as per:

Survivability

Damage

Dealt

Ram Damage dealt

You get bonus marks for each, as per the wiki.

Grouping:

It is a free-for-all battle royale style game with a scalable arena.

We will do 250 rounds with everyone and take the top 16, for 1000 rounds and that will be the final score for the students.

If stalling does happen, the robot with the lowest power will be killed by the admin. If there is two robots with the same power then it will be a coinflip to decide which one gets killed. This is repeated until there is no more stalling robots.

Arena:

The names will be hidden â€“ To prevent teaming

For the top 16 battle royale:

The size will be 1200 x 1200, with a border with width of 200, meaning the safe zone has a size of 800x800.

For the prior match:

The size will be 2000 x 2000, with a border with width of 200.

There will be 4 sentry turrets in the border to kill robots for leaving the battlefield. There is a method to check if the robot scanned is a sentry turret, so try not to lock onto it.
